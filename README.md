# Java-Training
This repository provides teaching materials for Java training.

## Getting Started
Following issues are introduced step by step at each commit. Please use the links provided to see code examples of the aforementioned issue.

### First Code
* [Hello World](https://github.com/Umit-Soylu/Java-Training/tree/HelloWorld) example for calling a java program from terminal.

### Core Concepts of Java
* [Variables](https://github.com/Umit-Soylu/Java-Training/tree/Variables) are described. Primitive & Hierarchiycal types are examplified.
* [Methods](https://github.com/Umit-Soylu/Java-Training/tree/Methods) are described for return types and void types. 
* [Packages](https://github.com/Umit-Soylu/Java-Training/tree/Packages), which allows storing classes in their respected package hierarchy, is introduced.
* [Access Modifiers](https://github.com/Umit-Soylu/Java-Training/tree/Modifiers), which allows classes, methods, and variables visibility from different packages, classes, and methods, are introduced.
* [Program Flow](https://github.com/Umit-Soylu/Java-Training/tree/ProgramFlow) using following capabilities are introduced:
  - Arithmetic operators can be found in [Arithmetic Operators Package](src/com/bilgeadam/java/tutorials/program_flow/arithmetic_operators)
  - Assignment operators can be found in [Assignment Operators Package](src/com/bilgeadam/java/tutorials/program_flow/assignment_operators)
  - Relational operators can be found in [Relational Operators Package](src/com/bilgeadam/java/tutorials/program_flow/relational_operators)
  - Logical operators can be found in [Logical Operators Package](src/com/bilgeadam/java/tutorials/program_flow/logical_operators)
  - Decision operators can be found in [Decision Operators Package](src/com/bilgeadam/java/tutorials/program_flow/decision_operators)
* [Exceptions](https://github.com/Umit-Soylu/Java-Training/tree/Exceptions) is examplified using mathematical operands and tested via unit tests.
* [Constructors](https://github.com/Umit-Soylu/Java-Training/tree/Constructors) are defined. Default constructor and custom constructors are introduced.
